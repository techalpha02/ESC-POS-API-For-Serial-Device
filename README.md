This is a sample PCF Component that will help your PowerApp interact with a Serial Device using the local server (provided in a seperate project).
Make sure to run the server in background before running this component or starting your PowerApp.
Upon clicking 'Connect' button, this sample component will write what ever message the user inputs in a text box, over the serial port of the device.
Place the server.json file in the root directory of your PCF Component, along with package.json file.
